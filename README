X Letters 2 (Unicode) - Catch falling words

This version 2 is a major rewrite, so expect bugs and broken features
(with respect to xletters versions 1.1.x). Some features described in
the doc (e.g. the possibility to select dictionary entries according
to difficulty levels) are not implemented yet. 
Below you can find: 
* install instructions
* comments about new features and un-features

----------------------------------------------------------
* warnings for an installation alongside an old xletters (version <= 1.1.x)

Beware that any previous version of xletters will share its application
defaults with this one.

----------------------------------------------------------
* install instructions

0. Read the GPL carefully if you don't know it by heart already.  You
can find it in the file COPYING.  It applies to xletters.

1. Edit the file xletters.h; you can leave everything untouched if you
want.

2. Build xletters by typing
	./configure && make

3. Become root and install xletters by typing
	make install
You may want to make xletters sgid games. Read the INSTALL
file for further information.
Except for the score file, everything will go into /usr/local by
default. A directory /var/local/games/lib/xletters is created, with a 
world-readable empty score file inside.

- Any UTF-8 encoded word list or dictionary may be used. See the file
"dictionary.html" for information about the file format. Word-lists
for xletters v<=1.1.x will continue to work. See the included
Japanese-english dictionary "jp-en.txt" as an example of xletters new
capabilities (distinction between drawn and typed characters, input
conversion layer). If you create or find a word list or dictionary you
would like to share, please drop a note.

The included "jp-en.txt" is a processed version of the
Japanese-English Electronic Dictionary File EDICT 25APR02 V02-001, and
is copyright J.W. Breen - 2002).

- The tranlation tables to convert keyboard input to typed characters
(in the case of japanese: kana) are contained in the file
"inputconv.txt". You can edit this file with any editor capable of
reading and saving Unicode in UTF-8 format.

- New options:
  -showk n, which says if and how the kana transcription should be shown
    next to the kanji. The value of the integer parameter n is
    somewhere between 0 (don't show furigana transcription) and 31
    (preselect transcription and show everything you can) and is
    obtained by summing the numbers in front of the desired behaviour:
     1 show typed part of furigana, in the lower part of the screen
     2 show typed part of furigana, always
     4 show untyped part of furigana, in the lower part of the screen
     8 show untyped part of furigana, always
    16 pick one furigana transcription at the beginning (i.e. 
       to destroy word, only this transcription will work). This implies +8 
       to avoid frustration.

  -showc n, which says if and how the comment/translation should be shown:
    n=0 don't show comment/translation
    n=1 show comment/translation, in the lower part of the screen
    n=2 show comment/translation, always

- Don't try to put CONTEXT = 1 in xletters.h. It won't work.

- The deathmatch and duel modes are broken. Sorry.
