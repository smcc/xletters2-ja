2004-1-11  Extended inputconv.txt to be much more liberal (and corrected a 
 2.0.4     bug for katakana-dzu). Now hopefully accepts everything existing
           input-methods accept (and more), e.g.  double consonnants for
           small-tsu preceding a consonnant, etc. 
           Added (still to inputconv.txt) a compositing table for western
           european languages (incomplete).

2004-1-6   Included jp-en.txt pre-processed to include markers and 
 2.0.3     meta-information (see CompJapanEngDict.java).
           Attempt to merge with Felipe Bergo (bergo@seul.org)'s 1.1.1
           branch: *adding automake/autoconf building,
             (binary will be called "xletters2" until code becomes 
             reasonably stable)
                   *renaming config.h to xletters.h

2003-7-21  Fixed big SEGFAULT bug in 2.1.  When running into 
 2.0.2     difficulties at establishing the kana2kanji correspondence,
 (alias    xletters now prints the word-file line number where player need 
 jp-2.2)   to help with markers.

2003-7-21  major rewrite: handles kanji words; words may have several
 2.0.1     kana-transcriptions, plus possibly a translation/comment;
 (alias    dictionary file is now UTF-8 Unicode; word lists for original
 jp-2.1)   xletters (v<=1.10) are accepted; input-conversion rules are 
           read at runtime, also UTF-8 format; ...

2003-5-17  (version naming changed to avoid confusion with new 
 2.0.0     potential normal xletters versions)
 (alias    merged romajikana.cnv and ascii_jis0208.txt
 jp-2.0)   minor changes to ascii_jis0208 translation table

2003-5-12  first xletters version patched for Japanese dictionnary
 1.1.0jp   starting point: original xletters version 1.1.0
