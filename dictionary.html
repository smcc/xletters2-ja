<h1>xletters dictionary format description</h1>

<p>xletters can use any word list, in any language, provided it has
the format described here. This format extends Jim Breen's EDICT
format to include some more information to help xletters. In
particular, EDICT-format dictionaries like the Japanese-English
&quot;edict&quot; will work with xletters out of the box provided they
are stored as UTF-8 Unicode. But note that even simple word lists (one
word per line) satisfy the format. 

<h2>a few examples</h2>

<ul>
<li> <em>plain word list:</em>
<pre><code>
  nice
  mice
  Don't_Panic_!
  Mäuse
  rêve
  Спасибо
  ...
</code></pre>
</li>
<li> <em>dictionary:</em>
<pre><code>
  Mäuse /mice/
  rêve /dream/
  Спасибо /thank you/
  ...
</code></pre>
</li>
<li> <em>Unicode- or TeX-trainer ;-):</em>
<pre><code>
  ∫ [integral] [0x222B] [\int]
  ⊙ [circled dot operator] [0x2299] [\bigodot]
  ∀ [for all] [0x2200] [\forall]
  ...
</code></pre>
</li>
</ul>

<h2>dictonary line format</h2>

The lines of the dictionary have basically the form:
<pre>
KANJI [KANA] /TRANSLATION/ &lt;META-INFO&gt;
</pre>
Note that the symbols "[]", "//", "&lt;&gt;" are needed to identify their
content as KANA, TRANSLATION and META-INFO respectively. </p>

<p>One and exactly one KANJI field is mandatory. At least one [KANA]
field is needed except if KANJI can be entered literally (see <a
href="#ref2" name="deref2">*Pure kana word*</a> rule below). The other
fields are optional.</p>

<h2>file format</h2>

<p>The file format is UTF-8 Unicode. The field separating spaces and the
delimiters "[]", "//"
and "&lt;&gt;" are the ASCII versions. Provided you compile xletters
to use the appropriate font, any Unicode character is allowed in the
dictionary (in any of the KANJI, KANA and TRANSLATION fields).</p>

<p>To edit the dictionary file or write your own, you need an editor
able to read and save UTF-8 encoded files (e.g. "GNU emacs", or
"TextEdit" on Mac-OS 10). Otherwise please refer to recoding programs
like "recode" or "iconv" (GNU programs, use Google) to convert to and
from your editor's coding.</p>

<h2>field descriptions</h2>

<dl>
<dt>KANJI</dt>
<dd>is the word that will fall. It can be any mixture of Unicode
characters that your computer can diplay.
</dd>

<dt>KANA</dt>
<dd>is the text that the player will have to type to destroy the word. 
For japanese words this will be a hiragana or katakana transcription
of the KANJI word. KANA must contain only letters and symbols which 
may be entered directly on the keyboard or whose
keyboard equivalent is described in the inputconv.txt file. Note that
the ASCII point (&quot;.&quot;) has a special meaning: The point
&quot;.&quot; is used to tell xletters which kana correspond to a
given kanji from KANJI (see <a href="#ref3" name="deref3">*Kana
separation*</a> below); it is not printed and need not be typed.
</dd>

<dt>TRANSLATION</dt>
<dd>is a comment on the word which can optionally be displayed next to
the falling word. It has no special role in the game, apart from
giving the player a clue and teach. Typically, it will be a
translation in some other language. It is displayed with its own font (see config.h),
so any characters contained in that font are possible here.
</dd>

<dt>META-INFO</dt>
<dd>is used to characterize the word further.
Currently, it contains the frequency-of-use ranking of the least used
kanji (F&lt;num&gt;), and the maximum Jouyou grade level of the kanji in the
word (G&lt;num&gt;). See Jim Breen's kanjidic documentation for information
about these fields. Thanks to this META-INFO, the player can restrict the
dictionary to certain levels.
</dd>
</dl>

<h2>additional rules</h2>

<dl>
<dt><a href="#deref2" name="ref2"></a>Pure kana word (KANJI==KANA)</dt>
<dd>
  If KANJI contains only typable characters (i.e. you know how to enter them on the keyboard), then the whole
  dictionary line may take the simple form<br>
  KANA /TRANSLATION/ &lt;META-INFO&gt;<br>
  effectively omitting the redundant field.<br>
  For Japanese with the included input-conversion (file: <code>inputconv.txt</code>), this is the case when
  KANJI contains only hiragana and katakana (i.e. the content of
  KANA is identical to the one of KANJI).  <em>Example:</em><br>
  けれども /(conj) but/however/<br>
  For most languages other than Japanese, this format is sufficient. 
  As an example, a russian dictionary could be made, with the KANA
  field containing the word in Cyrillic; an adapted inputconv.txt file
  would indicate how cyrillic letters are entered on a non-cyrillic
  keyboard.
</dd>

<dt>More than one translation</dt>
<dd>
  TRANSLATION may contain more than one translation. Translations are
  juxtaposed, separated by the "/" character. xletters then chooses
  one of the translations randomly. <em>Example:</em><br>
  あの人 [あのひと] /he/she/that person/
</dd>

<dt>More than one reading</dt>
<dd>
  There may be more than one KANA transcription for a given word. Two
  cases have to be distinguished
  <ol>
  <li> Different readings have different translations. In this case,
  use several lines:<br>
  KANJI [KANA1] /TRANSLATION1/ &lt;META-INFO&gt;<br>
  KANJI [KANA2] /TRANSLATION2/ &lt;META-INFO&gt;<br>
  ...<br>
  <em>Example:</em><br>
  一月 [いちがつ] /(n-adv) January/<br>
  一月 [ひとつき] /one month/<br></li>

  <li>The translation is the same for the different readings. In this
  case, the different readings may follow each other on the same line:<br>
  KANJI [KANA1] [KANA2] ... /TRANSLATION/ &lt;META-INFO&gt;<br>
  with as many kana transcriptions as needed. <em>Example:</em><br>
  一言 [いちごん] [ひとこと] /(n) single word/</li>
  </ol>
  Note that the two may be mixed arbitrarily, as in:<br>
  KANJI [KANA1] [KANA2] /TRANSLATION1/ &lt;META-INFO&gt;<br>
  KANJI [KANA3] /TRANSLATION2/ &lt;META-INFO&gt;
</dd>

<h2><a href="#deref3" name="ref3"></a>Kana separation</h2>

xletters prints the typed part of a word in a different color, to
help the player monitor progress. Because there are many readings for
each kanji, and xletters is oblivious of this, xletters needs
help in determining when a kanji has been completed. Therefore, the
KANA transcription contains ASCII points (".") to mark the end of
kanji. For example, "一月" (January) is made up of two kanji which
represent two kana each in the reading いちがつ, so that a point would
be needed after "いち" and another after "がつ", resulting in the
line:<br>
一月 [いち.がつ] /(n-adv) January/<br>
(the second point can be omitted because it is the end of the word)
To avoid lengthy editing, some heuristics is built into xletters to
decompose many cases without the need for point marks. If xletters is
unsure about a decomposition, it will print a warning on standard
error. Therefore, when you build your own dictionary, you can usually
start playing with it without worrying about putting "." marks in the
KANA transcriptions, and take care only of the cases where xletters
complains and/or does a bad job. You can also have a look at the CompJapanEngDict utility, which uses a kanji dictionary to find possible decompositions (doing the job for you in about 95-98% of the cases).<p>

xletters's heuristics works as follows:
<ol>
<li> try to match kana in the KANJI field to those in the KANA
  field.</li>
<li> if this isolates kanji individually, as it does in words
  containing only one kanji and words with kanji surrounded/separated
  by kana (e.g. 一つ一つ), the remaining kana in KANA can be
  associated in a unique way to the kanji.</li>
<li> for all other cases, a delimited block in the KANJI string is
  drawn as typed all at once when the corresponding block of kana has
  been typed. A warning is issued (<a href="#ref1"
  name="deref1">*remark*</a>).</li>
</ol>

<p>
<a href="#deref1" name="ref1">*remark*</a> For groups of kanji, if the
number of kana is the same as the number of kanji, one would be
tempted to attribute one kana to each kanji. I chose not to implement
this because this method can be deceiving: it suggests that in お祖母
さん, whose reading is おばあさん, 祖 corresponds to ば and 母 to あ,
although these are not readings of the respective kanji.</li> For this
specific case, I would rather suggest that 祖母 be associated <it>en
bloc </it> to ばあ, i.e. write the kana transcription as &quot;おばあ.
.さん&quot;. The effect of the two adjacent points is to complete both
kanji at the same point when the word is typed. Of course, this is a
matter of personal taste.</p>

<em>Examples:</em>
<ul>
<li> 小売り店 [こうりてん] /retail store/retail shop/<br> step 1)
        successfully matches the り in the KANJI string to the same
        hiragana in the KANA sequence (because it is unique). This
        isolated the last kanji 店, so that step 2) can associate the
        transcription てん to it. However, the first two kanji form a
        block, so a warning is issued. The behaviour in the game
        corresponds to &quot;こう..りてん&quot;, where the correct
        notation would be &quot;こ. う.りてん&quot; (one kana
        attributed to each of the two first kanji).</li>
<li> お願い致します [おねがいいたします] /(hon) please/<br>
  The first and the last three hiragana are matched in step 1), but
  there are two possibilities for matching the い. xletters prints
  a warning and marks 願い致 as a block which is highlighted as a
  whole when the player has typed everything up to た. Ugly. In
  point-notation, the result is &quot;おねがいいた..します&quot; when
  it should rather be &quot;おねが.いいた.します&quot;.
</li>
<li> 大雨 [おおあめ] /(n) heavy rain/<br>
  Without further knowledge, xletters can't know whether the first
  kanji corresponds to one, two or three kana. Therefore the player
  must type all four kana before both kanji are simultaneously
  highlighted and then erased (because the word is destroyed). Thus
  there is no visual feedback on the typing progress here.</li>
<li> play xletters and compare what you see to the content of the
  dictionary...</li>
</ul>

For the sake of clarity, it should be stressed again that this
decomposition issue can be safely ignored if one is happy with
xletters's default behaviour. It's only about improving the visual
feedback to the typing player.
